                        SAN FRANCISCO — It was the first morning of summer, the
                        start of fog season. But the sky above the Golden Gate
                        Bridge remained clear and blue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chris Dzierman, a bridge painter and foreman, looked to
                        the west. Near the horizon, where water usually meets
                        sky, a thick fog bank lurked. He wondered if and when it
                        would roll in, as fog usually does on summer afternoons,
                        smothering the bridge and beyond in wind and whiteness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It could last three minutes or three hours,” Mr.
                        Dzierman said. “It’s fog. It’s got a mind of its own.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every summer, fog breathes life into the Bay Area. But
                        people who pay attention to its finer points, from
                        scientists to sailors, city residents to real estate
                        agents, gardeners to bridge painters, debate whether
                        there is less fog than there used to be, as both science
                        and general sentiment suggest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ecological, economic and social effects of fog are
                        profound, perhaps no more than in Northern California.
                        Changes would be life-altering. But understanding fog is
                        one of science’s toughest tricks. Quantifying the
                        changes and determining possible causes, including
                        global warming, is climatology’s version of chasing
                        ghosts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That day on the bridge, computer models predicted the
                        fog would push through the Golden Gate in an hour or
                        two. Mr. Dzierman trusts his gut. He had a hunch it
                        would stay away, defying the familiar summertime cycle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just then, a slight breeze, an invisible puff of chill,
                        the kind you might get by opening the freezer door.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Feel that?” he said, inhaling deeply. “Mother Nature’s
                        air-conditioning. Yeah, that feels good.”
                    </p>
                    <p>It was a tease.</p>
                    <p>
                        The day remained gloriously sunny, unusually hot and
                        fog-free, the kind of San Francisco summer’s day that
                        some fear is becoming more frequent. The bridge’s five
                        fog horns went unused, for now.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While coastal fog isn’t unique to the California coast,
                        few places in the world are so deeply associated with
                        the ethereal movements and cooling spritz of fog’s
                        peek-a-boo routine. Fog pours through the Golden Gate
                        and crawls up and down the wrinkled hills of the city
                        and the nearby coast. It cloaks and chills. Millions are
                        affected by it, if only by the invisible cool breezes
                        that presage the fog’s arrival.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fog is why one neighborhood is notoriously chilly,
                        another is surprisingly sunny, and the airport is where
                        it is. It is why realtors talk about neighborhood fog
                        patterns as much as square footage and schools. It is
                        why fewer than half of Bay Area residents have
                        air-conditioning, and partly why they use less water
                        than most Americans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Summer fog is why the mighty coastal redwoods grow where
                        they do, surviving California’s dry season thanks to
                        refreshing gulps of cold, wet air. It is why, until
                        recently, few people worried about wildfires along the
                        coast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In June, July and August, as most of the Northern
                        Hemisphere, and most of California, feels the full force
                        of summer heat, the average daily high in San Francisco
                        is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 21 Celsius,
                        coolest of any major city in the continental United
                        States.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fog is a companion, part of the rhythm of summertime,
                        flitting in and out of lives like a family member. But
                        it does more than astonish ill-prepared tourists and
                        dazzle photographers and poets. It nourishes the natural
                        world. It enriches the area’s cultural identity. It
                        might even be an untapped resource in California’s
                        growing anxiety over water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Which is why a decrease in California’s coastal fog, or
                        the prospect of it disappearing entirely one day, is not
                        a sunny proposition, particularly in and around San
                        Francisco Bay.

                    <p>
                        The general consensus among the small cadre of
                        scientists who study coastal fog is that it is
                        decreasing, not just in California, but around the
                        world. However, the reasons aren’t clear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fog may be the most difficult meteorological phenomenon
                        to capture, calculate and predict. Unlike temperature,
                        precipitation, humidity or wind, there is no reliable
                        gauge for it. There is not even a practical definition
                        of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most will say that fog is a cloud that touches the
                        ground, which sounds simple enough. But fog is movement
                        in three dimensions, dipping and rising, forming and
                        disappearing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes a thin layer hugs the water below the Golden
                        Gate Bridge, blinding mariners. Sometimes it settles
                        about 200 feet higher, blinding drivers. Sometimes it
                        shrouds the top of the bridge’s towers and the airspace
                        above, blinding pilots. Sometimes it does it all. Which
                        of those things is fog?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It arrives like a whisper and disappears like a magic
                        trick. It is there one moment and gone the next.

                        Fog catchers have become increasingly common in the
                        region.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Early on a late-spring morning, Peter Weiss, a scientist
                        at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and three
                        of his students, calling themselves “the fog squad,”
                        were erecting fog catchers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea, simpler than the execution, is to harvest
                        water from passing fog. A fog catcher is a stretched
                        piece of mesh that, when it works, becomes saturated by
                        fog moisture, dripping into a gutter, leading to a
                        cistern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea is not new. Fog from the ocean is a dependable
                        feature in several places around the globe, mostly on
                        the west coasts of major continents. Villages in places
                        like Peru and Chile, sometimes with almost no rain
                        throughout the year, have for centuries sustained
                        themselves largely on fog water. Its use is growing in
                        places like Morocco.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The question in a changing climate is whether fog water
                        is a viable resource, if not a solution, for populated
                        places expecting a drier future. Places like California.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I would tend to think of it as a small drop in the
                        bucket,” said Dan Fernandez, a professor in the
                        Department of Applied Environmental Science at
                        California State University, Monterey Bay, and a leading
                        researcher in fog-catching. “But we need a lot of small
                        drops in the bucket to deal with what we have coming.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea of catching fog comes from nature. It is how
                        the tallest trees in the world, California’s coastal
                        redwoods, survive.

                        Decades ago, Todd Dawson stumbled into the uncrowded
                        world of fog research. Traipsing among the redwoods as
                        an undergraduate at the University of California, Santa
                        Cruz, he wondered why they were habitually moist, and
                        the ground around them so soggy, even mossy, even in
                        mid-summer, California’s dry season, when rain is rare.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fog, obviously. But little had been done to quantify
                        fog’s importance to California’s ecosystems.
                    </p>
                    <p>“That kind of haunted me,” he said.</p>

                        Years later, as a professor of integrative biology at
                        the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Dawson
                        studied redwoods and concluded that 30 to 40 percent of
                        their annual moisture arrives in the form of fog.

                    <p>
                        The high canopies of redwoods are giant filters for
                        drifting fog. The trees get drenched and nourished;
                        water drips to the forest floor. There it sustains other
                        plants and helps keep stream beds from drying, aiding
                        species from lichens to ferns, newts to salmon.

                    <p>
                        “Fog is a big water subsidy,” Dr. Dawson said. “And I
                        said, ‘My goodness, we’re ignoring this. We’ve been
                        missing a big part of the hydrologic budget of the
                        redwood forest.’”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2010, Dr. Dawson and a graduate student, James
                        Johnstone, published another study with an
                        attention-grabbing conclusion: Using observational data
                        at airports in the coastal redwood region — from central
                        California to its northern border, including the Bay
                        Area — they found that the frequency of fog, measured by
                        fog hours per day, had dropped 33 percent since the
                        middle of the 20th century. Fog was disappearing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The ramifications extend far beyond a single species of
                        tree. Does the long-term survival of redwoods and their
                        ecosystems depend on fog? (Probably.) What about
                        fog-cooled agricultural areas, like the Salinas Valley
                        to the south of the Bay Area, or the grape-growing Napa
                        Valley to the north? (Shifts in fog would affect them,
                        surely.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From a more human standpoint, what would happen to water
                        use, power grids, solar farms and wind turbines? How
                        would the future migrations of human populations be
                        affected? And would San Francisco be, well, San
                        Francisco without fog?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Less fog is a game changer for a lot of things,” Dr.
                        Dawson said. For fog catchers, ambitions are realistic,
                        motivations are simple: Why not try to squeeze water
                        from air, especially in dry, dire times like these?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite its reputation, San Francisco isn’t the foggiest
                        city in America. In fact, when compared with the rest of
                        the United State’s major cities, it falls well below the
                        competition. It’s famous low-lying cloud structures are
                        densely concentrated in the summer months - a
                        make-or-break season for fog catchers.

                        Instead of building fake redwoods, researchers build fog
                        catchers. Results are highly variable — by day, by
                        location, by type of mesh, by the fickle gods of fog.
                        The most that Dr. Fernandez has collected from a single
                        catcher, made of one square meter of special mesh, was
                        37 liters of water in a day. Any location that
                        dependably captures an average of more than a liter a
                        day during the summer, he said, might be worth
                        expanding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Fog is great,” Dr. Fernandez said. “It’s not rain. But
                        it’s something.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Weiss, a friend of Dr. Fernandez’s and a fellow
                        researcher in nearby Santa Cruz, received a grant to
                        study larger collection systems, beginning this summer.
                        On the university’s hillside farm overlooking the
                        Pacific, Dr. Weiss and his students created mockups
                        using wood, mesh and guy wires. Sturdiness is vital; fog
                        is wind, and the bigger the catcher, the more it acts
                        like a sail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mesh, a bit like a weed fabric or a furnace filter,
                        is specifically designed to capture fog. But researchers
                        concoct variations. What works in a lab does not always
                        work in nature.

                        Maybe fog will never be enough to quench the thirst of
                        city dwellers and all their drinking, flushing and
                        washing. But could a farm that gets zero rain in the
                        summer, and uses no outside irrigation, survive on fog?
                        Maybe, depending on the crop and the fickleness of the
                        area’s fog.

                        “You could translate it from square meters of mesh to
                        food calories, something like that,” Dr. Weiss said.

                        In 2016 and 2018, a Bay Area distillery called Hangar
                        One produced small batches of Fog Point vodka, made from
                        fog water. Bottles sold for up to $100 each. But Dr.
                        Fernandez and Dr. Weiss want to believe that fog water
                        can be more than a gimmick. If it can nourish redwood
                        trees for thousands of years, maybe it can help humans
                        in coming decades.

                        Someday, they say, the foggy parts of California might
                        be covered in fog farms, not unlike the solar farms
                        found in sunnier spots. That depends on many factors,
                        not least the future existence of fog.

                        There may be no place with a deeper connection to fog
                        than the California coast, especially the 150 miles or
                        so from Monterey to Point Reyes National Seashore, where
                        the lighthouse, shrouded in fog about 200 days a year,
                        is one of the foggiest places on the continent.

                    <p>
                        Millions live within 50 miles of the coast along that
                        stretch. Daily high temperatures might fall short of 60
                        degrees near the ocean but be more than 100 degrees
                        inland, all depending on fog’s reach.

                        In between, many feel the effect of fog but rarely see
                        it — a breath of cool afternoon air, maybe, or a bracing
                        chilled wind that upends outdoor plans in the evening.
                    </p>
                    <p>But in some places, the fog puts on a show.</p>
                    <p>
                        It clings close to the ground, like a stalking cat.
                        Sometimes it pauses, sometimes it pounces. It slips
                        through topographic gaps. It peeks over the top of
                        hillsides and slinks into valleys. Sometimes it comes in
                        wisps. Sometimes in waves.

                    <p>
                        Sometimes the fog reaches one valley, one town, one
                        neighborhood — but not the next. Sometimes it smothers
                        everything in its path. “There’s rarely a July Fourth
                        fireworks celebration that anybody actually sees,” said
                        Phil Ginsburg, general manager of San Francisco
                        Recreation and Park Department.

                        Some locals love the fog. Some hate it. All deal with
                        it. Fog is such a part of the landscape that it even has
                        a name: Karl, personified through a wry, anonymous
                        Twitter account.
